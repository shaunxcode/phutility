Phutility is a collection of tools to make life in php more livable. 
Initially this means Invokable which is a utility for creating simple 
callbacks w/o having to define a function.

$collection->map(function($i) use($var1, $var2) { 
    return $i->someMethod()->someOther($var1)->someOther($var2);
});

Can become: 

use Phutility\Invokable as I;

$collection->map(I::someMethod()->someOther($var1)->someOther($var2));

As you may have inferred Invokable is a class which builds up a stack using __call and __get
and then further, implements the __invoke method so it may be used in any context
which an anonymous function would other wise. 

You could even do things like:

$x = I::callMethod(30)->secondMethod($arg2);

$x($y);
$x($z);

Which is equivelant to:

$y->someMethod(30)->secondMethod($arg2);
$z->someMethod(30)->secondMethod($arg2);

Obj is an alternative object model based more upon self (http://selflanguage.org/).
You can create new objects:

use Phutility\Obj;

$obj = Obj::create(
	'age', 30, 
	'name', 'peter',
	'sayWord', function($self, $word) {
		echo "{$self->name} says {$word}";
	}
);

You can access any of the slots like a normal object:
$obj->age += 40; 
$obj->sayWord("carrot");

You can "mixin" or "extend" and object by adding a parent like:

$obj->addParent(Obj::create(
	'doubleAgePlus', function($self, $plus) {
		return ($self->age * 2) + $plus;
	})
);
